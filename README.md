# Product Recommendation
This repository contains a modern implementation of a 2010 paper [Application of a Gaussian, Missing-Data Model to Product Recommendation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5430993) in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The author of this paper was in team "The Ensemble" in 2009's $1 million [Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize).

## Performance Evaluation
| Number of Movies (k) | Number of Users (n) | Data Preprocessing Time |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 100                  | 137328              | ~6 min                  |
| 17700                | 480189              | ~95 min                 |

The initial experiments are run on the 100 movies with the greatest number of observed. We obtain the following results amazingly identical to the results mentioned in paper:

| Algorithm | Iterations to Converge | Runtime | RMSE   | Initial Estimate of R | 
|-----------|------------------------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| EM        | 26                     | ~39 min | 0.9170 | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{R}^0_4">             |
| McMichael | 35                     | ~38 min | 0.9170 | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{R}^0_4">             |

For full-scale experiments:

| Algorithm | Iterations to Converge | Runtime | RMSE   | Initial Estimate of R | 
|-----------|------------------------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| EM        | 26                     |         |        | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{R}^0_4">             |
| McMichael | 35                     |         |        | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{R}^0_4">             |

All results were obtained using a 2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor with 32GB RAM. Note that `tf.function()` is used extensively (to construct callables that execute static TensorFlow graphs) to accelerate computing in this project.
