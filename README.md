# Product Recommendation
This repository contains a modern implementation of a 2010 paper [Application of a Gaussian, Missing-Data Model to Product Recommendation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5430993) in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The author of this paper was in team "The Ensemble" in 2009's $1 million [Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize).

## Performance Evaluation
The following results, amazingly identical to the results mentioned in paper, are obtained using `R_hat_4` to initialize:

| Number of Movies (k) | Number of Users (n) | Data Preprocessing Time |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 100                  | 137328              | ~12 min                 |

| Algorithm | Iterations to Converge | Runtime | RMSE   |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|--------|
| EM        | 26                     | ~39 min | 0.9170 |
| McMichael | 35                     | ~38 min | 0.9170 |

All results were obtained using a 2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor with 32GB RAM. Note that `tf.function()` is used extensively (to construct callables that execute static TensorFlow graphs) to accelerate computing in this project.
